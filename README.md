Acknowledgement:  
I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/) to aid in error-handling, as well as some additional explanations of code, which I used in my background research, self-study, and drafting of my initial code in modified form. 

Description of the use of AI:
I used ChatGPT to help with errors and bugs in my code, which I then adapted and further customised to my own project requirements. I used some further ChatGPT prompts to generate some high-level explanations about code to aid my background research and self-study on the topic of machine learning algorithms.
